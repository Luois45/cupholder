# cupholder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/cupholder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/cupholder) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/xyproto/cupholder)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/xyproto/cupholder) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL2-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyproto/cupholder/master/LICENSE)

Eject the CD tray, on Linux, using only Go.

If you have access to an unorganized server room with many servers with CD ROMs, this can be used for finding a specific server.

It can also be used for providing an additional tea or coffee cup holder to your desktop setup.

This is mainly an experiment in calling ioctls without using C, though.

## Usage

    ./cupholder

Or

    ./cupholder /dev/cdrom

All arguments are treated as device filenames.

Use `-s` for silent operation and set the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to disable colors.

## Web server

`cupholder` includes a web server that can be launched with the `-l` or `--listen` flag, that lets you eject the CD remotely, just by visiting the HTTP page at port 3280 (`3280 = 0x0CD0`).

For ejecting the tray using `curl`, a command like this can then be used:

    curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:3280/

Replace `localhost` with the hostname or IP address of the server where `cupholder -l` is running.
