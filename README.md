# Cupholder

Eject the CD tray, on Linux, using only Go.

If you have a server room with many servers with CD ROMs, this can be used for finding a specific server.

It can also be used for providing an additional coffee cup holder to your desktop setup.

## Usage

    ./cupholder

Or

    ./cupholder /dev/cdrom

All arguments are treated as device filenames.

Use `-s` for silent operation and set the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to disable colors.
